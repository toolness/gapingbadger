[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/toolness/gapingbadger.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/toolness/gapingbadger)

This is an [Open Badges](http://openbadges.org/) Badge issuing platform
that's a bit too open. Kind of like [openbadger](https://github.com/mozilla/openbadger) but way worse.

This software is basically a throwaway prototype. Use at your own risk.

## Quick Start

    git clone git://github.com/toolness/gapingbadger.git
    cd gapingbadger
    npm install
    npm test
